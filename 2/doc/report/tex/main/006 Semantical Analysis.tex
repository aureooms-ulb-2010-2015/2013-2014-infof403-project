\section{Semantical Analysis}

Our parser implements a simple semantical analysis. If a semantical error occurs an explicit $SemanticalException$ is thrown explaining the error. Here is the list of the errors our parser recognises.

\begin{itemize}

\item Usage of variables: when a variable is used, in an arithmetic expression or assignation, the analyser checks first if this variable exists.
\item Variable sizes: for every variable assignation the size of the variable is checked to match its new content.
\item Labels names: we don't let the user define several labels with the same name or with a name already used for a variable.
\item Program ID: the semantical analyser verifies that the program ID's at the beginning and the end of the SCOBOL program match.


\end {itemize}
