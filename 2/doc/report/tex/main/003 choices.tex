\section{Choices}

Here are described some choices we made for our implementation.


\subsection{Literal size}

Temporary variables representing SCOBOL literals are created in LLVM IR as signed integer on 64 bits. This is a direct consequence of the language used for our project: Java.


\subsection{Labels treated as functions}

In SCOBOL labels can be used. We chose to translate those labels in LLVM IR as functions. We can do this without loss of generality. This choice implies that the SCOBOL keyword $stop$ is not considered.

\subsection{Lazy evaluation}

Our LLVM IR code is written using the $lazy evaluation$ strategy. Composed boolean expressions (with $OR$ and $AND$) are evaluated only if necessary. This choice makes the execution of the code much faster.

\subsection{byte integers}

To reduce RAM fragmentation we chose to code LLVM IR integers on a size multiple of 8.
