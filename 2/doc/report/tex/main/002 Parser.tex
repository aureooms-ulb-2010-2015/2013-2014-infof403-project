\section{Generating the parser}

The parser is generated by a python script. For each rule it writes the java method checking all tokens, switching on first and follow sets if needed, and throwing an explicit exception in case of unexpected token.

The reason we decided to go with a python script is because it was easier to spot a mistake in the grammar and then regenerate the code.
