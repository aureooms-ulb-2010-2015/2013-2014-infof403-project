COBOL (\textbf{CO}mmon \textbf{B}usiness \textbf{O}riented \textbf{L}anguage) is a a project initiated by the United States
Department of Defense in order to simplify the implementation of management tools. The outcome of this
project was the definition of a rather verbose language popular between 1960 and
1980. This is why COBOL can be found, still today, as the software core of many big firms (e.g.
banks, insurances).

This is the second half of the compiler project. In this part of the project, we will finish the compiler by adding the parser and the semantics rules in order to produce an executable program from a S-COBOL source code.
