\subsection{Finite Automaton}
A simulator of the deterministic finite automaton (DFA) implemented for this assignment can be found in the dfa  folder of our work. This DFA recognizes only two S-COBOL keywords. The mechanism used to recognize the rest of the keywords can easily be deducted from those two examples.
