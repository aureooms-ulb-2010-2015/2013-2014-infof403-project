\subsubsection{DFA}

A state is a class composed of a \textit{token} (the read input so far) and one function \textit{next}. This method is the transition function, it takes as parameters a character and another state.

A state can be final, each of the final states are bounded to a syntactical unit, a meaningful token in S-COBOL. The other ones are non-final and correspond to the rejecting states of the DFA.
The DFA is then a map filled with all the states created.

The keywords and identifiers states have been automatically generated by a custom python script to avoid repetitive work.

In order to detect comments as they were defined in \ref{sec:impl:choices:comments}, we had to implement two DFA's : one for the tokens standing alone on a line and the second for all the other tokens. The detail of the implementation can be looked at in the \href{../more/src/cs/lang/LexicalAnalyzer3.java}{LexicalAnalyzer3 class}.
