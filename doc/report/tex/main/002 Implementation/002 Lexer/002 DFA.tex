\subsubsection{DFA}

A state is a class composed of a \textit{token} (the read input so far) and one function \textit{next}. This method is the transition function, it takes as parameters a character and another state.

A state can be final, each of the final states are bounded to a syntactical unit, a meaningful token in S-COBOL. The other ones are non-final and correspond to the rejecting states of the DFA.

The DFA is then a map filled with all the states created.

The keywords and identifiers states have been automatically generated by a custom python script to avoid repetitive work.
